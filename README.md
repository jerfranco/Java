# Overview

Java is one of the most used programming languages around the world. There is a reason why most companies continue to use Java in their software development. Just like C#, it is a object-oriented programming langauge. It is great for codes that have different methods. That is one of the reasons why I chose to do Java is because of it functionality.

The Java program when ran will give you four choices to choose from. It is a random number guesser game. It will keep track of the amount of tries and display it to the user. There are easy, medium, hard, and you can make your own guessing game.

The software that I used to program Java is Visual Studio Code.
